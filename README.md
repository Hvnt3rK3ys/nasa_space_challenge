This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## About the Challenge
Landsat missions have provided the longest continuous dataset of remotely sensed measurements of Earth‚Äôs land surface. Comparing ground-based spectral measurements with Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) data collected at the same time can facilitate experiential learning, encourage scientific exploration with satellite data, foster interdisciplinary and spatial thinking skills, and empower individuals to become informed global citizens. But to compare ground-based measurements with Landsat data, you need to know when Landsat will be passing over a specific land area, and then be able to access the Landsat data collected at that place and time. Your challenge is to develop a web-based application that supports the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data by allowing users to define a target location, receive notifications when Landsat is to pass over that location, and then access and display the corresponding Landsat SR data.



## About the team:
We're a team of developers üë©‚Äçüíª and mathematicians üßÆ:
Dedicated to creating value through our solutions. Specifically, we aim to optimize our algorithms to ensure that machine learning models run efficiently, consuming less energy and thereby conserving water. 
Our project focuses on developing a web-based application that supports the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data. 
This application will facilitate experiential learning, encourage scientific exploration, foster interdisciplinary and spatial thinking skills, and empower individuals to become informed global citizens.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
